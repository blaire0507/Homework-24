//Question 1 What is correlation used for?
<p1> 
Correlation is used for looking at the relationship between variables. Correlation focused on the likeness between variables, or the overall relationship, where causation is something else.

 //What is the difference between correlation and causation?   
<p2> 
Causation suggests (or is used to proves in some studies) the reason or cause of why something happens. A causes B to happen or behave in a certian way. Some are more concrete than others. Correlation is simply looking at what may be similar between two trends, what may be different, but not implying that something is happening to cause a specific effect.

//Compare and contrast 3 different ways to visually show relationships.
<p3> 

A linear relation ship is really good at showing correlation but sometimes more difficult to show causation, where a non-linear relationship, especially a curve, can be better to show causation than coorelation. This is also dependent upon the data being used and the relationships wanting to be shown. Layering or comparing two or more of these visuals as a visual in itself is the best combination to show coorelation and causation for a specific problem or to find more information on a topic about the relationships given.
